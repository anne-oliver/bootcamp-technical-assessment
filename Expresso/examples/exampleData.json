      "Add the whole spices to a mortar and crush them lightly into smaller pieces.",
      "In a small pot, bring the water to a boil on medium to high heat and add the black tea and spices. Simmer for two minutes, or until the tea leaves and spices have released flavor and color. Then, bring the heat down to medium and pour in the milk.",
      "Bring the chai to a boil, so that it starts aerating and bubbling to the top. Remove the pot from heat until the bubbles come down. Replace the pot on the burner and bring the chai back up again to a boil and remove from heat a second time until the bubbles go back down.",
      "Continue to simmer the chai until desired consistency and color, about 2-4 minutes. Some of the liquid will have evaporated by now, so the chai should be smooth and creamy. Remove the pot from heat.",
      "Strain the chai with a sieve into glasses, mugs, or a tea pot. Mix in the sugar according to taste, and serve."
